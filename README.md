# Sow-Feed-Intake
Project on Sow Feed  Intake Data - ANSC595

This project aims to solidify our knowledge of pig modeling under Dr. Schinckel's guidance. 
We have access to a dataset on sow feed intake that contains: 
  - SowID
  - Daily Feed intake
  - Parity
  - Max Temp
  - Dew Temp
  - Max Temp above 24

With this, we are planning to:
  1. fit the best model for sow feed intake data
  2. add environmental covbariables
  3. predict the next day feed intake using machine learning
